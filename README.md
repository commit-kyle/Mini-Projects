## General info
Within this mini-project we show some image cards where only one is initially expanded and the rest are narrowed or squeezed together. 
We allow the user to click on the card of their choice which allows for the narrow card to be expanded so that the entire picture shown on the card can be seen.

## Live website
The link for a live demonstration of how this app works can be found here;

I hope you've enjoyed it!
