## General info
Within this mini-project we start with a blurred background image and give the user an option to clear up the image by clicking a button.
Once the click event is triggered, we have a variable which we increment from 0 until it reaches the number 100. We then decrease the blur of the background image from 30px down to 0px with respect to the percentage of our fluctuating value.
