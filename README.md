## General info
Within this mini-project we introduce a scroll animation.
We start off by showing three 'boxes' and as we scroll down more boxes are brought into the viewport. These new boxes are showing sweeping in from the right and left sides of the screen. The boxes will then disappear in the same fashion when we scroll back up.

## Live website
The link for a live demonstration of how this app works can be found here;

I hope you've enjoyed it!
